# fish-poke Overview
Hierarchical Bayesian model for predicting reef fish biomass in the main Hawaiian Islands using NOAA's public-access coral reef ecosystem monitoring data

## Outputs
* Coefficient for multiple biophysical and human population drivers of reef fish biomass
* "Pristine" reef fish biomass (i.e., by setting the effect of human population density to its minimum value)
* Reef fish biomass recovery potential (i.e., the difference between pristine and present-day levels)
